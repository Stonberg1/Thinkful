1. What are the three longest trips on rainy days?

ANSWER:
1. "Palo Alto Caltrain Station" to "Palo Alto Caltrain Station"
2. "California Ave Caltrain Station" to "University and Emerson"
3. "Stanford in Redwood City" to "Redwood City Caltrain Station"
CODE:
SELECT
	t.duration,
	t.start_station,
	t.end_station,
	w.events
FROM 
	trips t
JOIN
	weather w
ON
	t.zip_code = w.zip
WHERE w.events LIKE '%Rain%'
GROUP BY 1,2,3,4
ORDER BY t.duration DESC;

2. Which station is full most often?

ANSWER:
"Santa Clara at Almaden"
CODE:
SELECT
	stations.name,
	(CASE WHEN status.docks_available = 0 THEN 'full' ELSE 'not' END) station_capacity,
	COUNT (*) as capacity_count
FROM 
	stations
JOIN
	status
ON
	stations.station_id = status.station_id
GROUP BY 2,1
ORDER BY 3 DESC

3. Return a list of stations with a count of number of trips starting at that station but ordered by dock count.

CODE:
SELECT
	start_station,
	dockcount,
	COUNT(*)
FROM
	trips
JOIN
	stations
ON
	stations.name=trips.start_station
GROUP BY 1, 2
ORDER BY 2 DESC;

4. (Challenge) What's the length of the longest trip for each day it rains anywhere?
*Had to take a look at the answer here...

ANSWER:
WITH rainy
AS	(
	SELECT
	DATE(date) weather_date
	From weather
	WHERE events = 'Rain'
	GROUP BY 1
	),
rain_trips
AS (
	SELECT
	trip_id,
	duration,
	DATE(trips.start_date) rain_trips_date
	FROM trips
	JOIN rainy
	on rainy.weather_date = DATE(trips.start_date)
	ORDER BY duration DESC
	)
SELECT 
	rain_trips_date,
	MAX(duration) max_duration
FROM
	rain_trips
GROUP BY 1
ORDER BY max_duration DESC
