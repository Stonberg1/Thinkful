    "Let's say we work at a credit card company and we're trying to figure out if people are going to pay their bills on time. We have everyone's purchases, split into four main categories: groceries, dining out, utilities, and entertainment. What are some ways you might use KNN to create this model? What aspects of KNN would be useful? Write up your thoughts in submit a link below."

    "These units would likely be on a very different scale, so I would normalize them by z-scores. I would choose, if anything, a larger K, as this model should avoid overfitting - there will always be more data to train on. And finally, I would create my own array of weights for each record based on how long the credit card user has used the card - making those observations more reliable if a person has a longer track record with using the credit card."
